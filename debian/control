Description: NFS client library (development files)
 LIBNFS is a client library for accessing NFS shares over a network.
 .
 LIBNFS offers three different APIs, for different use :
 1, RAW : A fully async low level rpc library for nfs protocols
 2, NFS ASYNC : A fully asynchronous library for high level vfs functions
 3, NFS SYNC : A synchronous library for high level vfs functions
 .
 This package provides the necessary files needed for development.
